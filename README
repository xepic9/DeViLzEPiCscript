These scripts were written in Python under Xubuntu. Most of them have been
tested on Fluxbox. I have created these code-lines in order to make my
Fluxbox fitted to my style and taste. However, I have found out that some
of these ideas fascinated my friend, what brought me to publish them here.

DevilzEpicScript is just a long funny name, it doesn't have any special
meaning, in case you may wonder.

This project has not been finished yet. There is a lot of stuff to re-write
and to re-build. I also have many ideas, which I want to apply.
Nevertheless, it can be done if others come and join.
